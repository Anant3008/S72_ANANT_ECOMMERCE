# Ecommerce-Follow-Along


MERN E-Commerce Application
-

Hey!  I am making my first web development effort with the development of a basic e-commerce store. Here, I'm learning about the MERN stack-MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js-as part of this project. And, as you guessed it, I'm writing all of my adventures down here.

## Project Description

A basic online store. Users can browse through the products, add them into a cart, and pretend to buy them-no real payments yet though. This is my very first full-stack project, and I am excited to learn how websites really work behind the scenes. It will start pretty simple and hopefully grow as I learn more.

## Learning Goals ????

As a beginner, I am hoping to
- Understand how websites are built from front to back
- Learn to write my first server code with Node.js
- Create my first database with MongoDB
- Build my first React application
- Figure out how all these pieces work together!
