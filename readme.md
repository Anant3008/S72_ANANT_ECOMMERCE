# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

# MERN E-Commerce Application

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my first step into web development, where I'll be building a simple online store from scratch. I'm learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) through this project, and I'll be documenting my journey here.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

In today's session, we covered:
1. Understanding what we're going to build
   - A simple online store with products and a shopping cart
   - A place for users to create accounts and log in

2. Setting up our development environment
   - Creating a GitHub repository
   - Learning about README files
   - Understanding project documentation

3. Planning our learning path
   - Breaking down the project into smaller pieces
   - Setting realistic goals for each milestone
   - Understanding what we'll learn along the way

## Milestone 2: Login Page Implementation

In this milestone, I've added a **login page** using React and styled it with **Tailwind CSS**. This marks an important step in the project as I'm now able to create a simple user login system. 

**Key updates include:**
- **Login Page UI:** Created a simple login page where users can input their credentials (email and password).
- **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Used Tailwind to quickly style the login page with modern UI components.
- **React State Management:** Managed form inputs and basic state within the React app to handle login credentials.

This login page will serve as the foundation for adding authentication functionality in the future.

## Project Description

I'm creating a basic online store where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and pretend to buy them (no real payments yet!). This is my first full-stack project, and I'm excited to learn how websites actually work behind the scenes. The project will start simple and grow as I learn more.

## Learning Goals ðŸŽ¯

As a beginner, I'm hoping to:
- Understand how websites are built from front to back
- Learn to write my first server code with Node.js
- Create my first database with MongoDB
- Build my first React application
- Figure out how all these pieces work together!

## Key Features of the Project

### MERN Stack
I'm learning these four technologies:
- **MongoDB:** Where I'll store all my project's data
- **Express:** Helps me create a server
- **React:** For building the website's interface
- **Node.js:** Lets me run JavaScript outside the browser

### REST API Creation
I'll be learning how to:
- Create my first API endpoints
- Send data between the frontend and backend
- Handle basic requests like getting product lists

### Authentication
Starting with simple features:
- **Basic login page** (completed!)
- User registration
- Learning about passwords and security

### Database Schema Design
My first database will include:
- A simple product list

- Order details

### Backend Development
Learning the basics of:
- Setting up a server
- Connecting to a database
- Handling basic requests

### Frontend Development
Starting with:
- Creating simple pages
- Making a basic shopping cart
- Displaying products

### Core Concepts Covered

#### Overview of the MERN Stack
I'll be learning:
- What each technology does
- How they work together
- Basic setup and configuration

#### REST API Structure and Endpoints
Starting with:
- What an API is
- How to create basic routes
- Sending and receiving data

#### Basics of Database Schema Design
Learning about:
